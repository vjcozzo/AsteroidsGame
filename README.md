# AsteroidsGame
A free-software implementation of the old arcade game, Asteroids. This project was originally developed for a Game Jam in March 2018. This implementation uses the Allegro 5 game libraries.

## Technical notes
*    ELF binaries have been added under ./bin 
*    Sometimes, especially on older distributions, the binaries alone are not sufficient to play the game. For these distros, you may need to use the directory for-static-release-dynamic-libs/, which contains dynamic libraries needed on older distributions.
