# AsteroidsGame
A free-software implementation of the old arcade game, Asteroids. This project was originally developed for a Game Jam in March 2018. This implementation uses the Allegro 5 game libraries.

## Technical note 
Static linking does not work on my machine any more. So cloning this repository may not guarantee that the game runs on your machine. This README will be updated when static linking problems are fixed; this should make the game more portable to different Linux distributions.
